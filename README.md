# Predicting Housing Prices

## Introduction

Welcome to the "Predicting Housing Prices" project! This project was completed during the Data Science Bootcamp. In this project, we aimed to create machine learning models to predict housing prices based on various property features. The project was divided into two main phases: a classification phase and a regression phase. We followed an iterative approach, starting with simple solutions and gradually refining our models.

## Project Context

Our client was a real estate consultancy specializing in pricing properties. They wanted to use data science to predict whether a property is expensive or not and to predict the exact price of houses. The project involved using a dataset containing historical housing prices in Ames, Iowa, along with around 80 different features for each house.

## Skills Developed

Throughout this project, we developed and applied various skills, including:

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analyzing and visualizing the dataset to understand its characteristics and identify patterns.
- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, duplicates, and ensuring data quality.
- **Feature Preprocessing:** Scaling, transforming, and encoding features for machine learning models.
- **Model Building:** Implementing classification and regression models using different algorithms.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Optimizing model performance through hyperparameter tuning.
- **Model Evaluation:** Using appropriate metrics for classification and regression tasks.
- **Feature Selection:** Identifying relevant features and assessing their impact on model performance.

## Libraries and Tools Used

We utilized various libraries and tools to complete this project:

- **Python:** The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- **Pandas:** Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy:** Utilized for numerical computations and array operations.
- **Matplotlib and Seaborn:** Employed for data visualization.
- **Scikit-Learn:** Utilized for implementing machine learning models, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
- **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for documenting code, insights, and analysis.

## Classification Models Explored

During the classification phase, we explored and implemented the following models:

- **Decision Tree Classifier**
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**
- **Random Forest Classifier**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

We evaluated these models using cross-validation techniques, grid search, and classification performance metrics.

## Regression Models Explored

In the regression phase, we explored various regression models:

- **Decision Tree Regression**
- **Random Forest Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression**

We assessed regression model performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R Squared.

## Conclusion

The "Predicting Housing Prices" project provided a comprehensive hands-on experience in data preprocessing, classification, regression, model evaluation, and iteration. By working through this project, we developed practical skills in analyzing real estate data, building accurate models, and interpreting results. This project demonstrates the application of data science techniques to real-world business challenges.
