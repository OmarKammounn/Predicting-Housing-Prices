# Predicting Housing Prices

**Introduction

Welcome to the "Predicting Housing Prices" project! This project was completed during the Data Science Bootcamp. In this project, the aim was to create machine learning models for predicting housing prices based on various property features. The project was divided into two main phases: a classification phase and a regression phase. An iterative approach was followed, starting with simple solutions and gradually refining the models.

**Project Context

The client was a real estate consultancy specializing in property pricing. The objective was to employ data science to predict whether a property is expensive or not and to predict the exact price of houses. The project involved using a dataset containing historical housing prices in Ames, Iowa, along with around 80 different features for each house.

**Skills Developed

Throughout this project, various skills were developed and applied, including:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset was analyzed and visualized to understand its characteristics and identify patterns.
- Data Cleaning: Missing values, duplicates, and data quality were managed.
- Feature Preprocessing: Features were scaled, transformed, and encoded for machine learning models.
- Model Building: Classification and regression models were implemented using different algorithms.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Model performance was optimized through hyperparameter tuning.
- Model Evaluation: Appropriate metrics for classification and regression tasks were used.
- Feature Selection: Relevant features were identified, and their impact on model performance was assessed.

**Libraries and Tools Used

Various libraries and tools were utilized to complete this project:

- Python: The primary programming language for data analysis and modeling.
- Pandas: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- NumPy: Utilized for numerical computations and array operations.
- Matplotlib and Seaborn: Employed for data visualization.
- Scikit-Learn: Utilized for implementing machine learning models, preprocessing, and model evaluation.
- Jupyter Notebooks: Used for documenting code, insights, and analysis.

**Classification Models Explored

During the classification phase, exploration and implementation were carried out on the following models:

- Decision Tree Classifier
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest Classifier
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Models were evaluated using cross-validation techniques, grid search, and classification performance metrics.

**Regression Models Explored

In the regression phase, exploration was done on various regression models:

- Decision Tree Regression
- Random Forest Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Regression

Regression model performance was assessed using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error, Root Mean Squared Error, and R Squared.

**Conclusion

The "Predicting Housing Prices" project offered a comprehensive hands-on experience in data preprocessing, classification, regression, model evaluation, and iteration. By engaging in this project, practical skills were developed in analyzing real estate data, building accurate models, and interpreting results. The project showcased the application of data science techniques to real-world business challenges.
